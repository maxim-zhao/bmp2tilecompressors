; "Standard" version (70 bytes)
; modified for sms vram by aralbrec
; modified for asm by Maxim :)
; ===============================================================
; 
; Usage:
; ld hl, <source>
; ld de, <destination>
; call zx7_decompress
;
; Note:
; - Define ZX7ToVRAM before including to output to VRAM. 
;   Destination address must then be ORed with $4000.
; - Define ZX7ToVRAMScreenOn in addition to make it
;   interrupt-safe (di and ei around VRAM access), 
;   not assume the VRAM state is stable,
;   and access VRAM slower so it can run while the screen is on.
; - If you do not specify interrupt safety then you must
;   make sure any interrupts do not alter the VDP VRAM state
;   (i.e. do not read or write anything) and that the screen
;   is off (or in VBlank if your data is really small).
; - Define ZX7NoUndocumented to avoid use of undocumented opcodes.
;   This is for compatibility with some clone Z80s.
;
; This version only supports match lengths up to 255. This enables 
; it to be smaller and faster, but it is not 100% compatible with
; the standard ZX7 compressor. However, in most cases it is because
; match lengths greater than that are very unlikely for most data.
;
; Uses af, bc, de, hl

  ; This is a trick whereby we can cycle a flags byte in a through the carry flag,

  ; consumed.

  ; add a, a ; get MSB into carry
  ; jr z, _nextFlagsByte ; get new flags byte if necessary (and shift it into carry)
